\f0\b\fs32 \cf2 Blog 5: Frequent Pattern Analysis using Association Rule Mining\
\
Introduction\
\
Frequent Pattern Analysis helps in finding repeating patterns in data. Association Rule Mining (ARM) is a technique that discovers relationships between items in a dataset.\
\
What is Association Rule Mining?\
\
It is used to identify relationships between items in large datasets. A common example is market basket analysis, which determines which products are frequently bought together.\
\
Key Terms\
	\'95	Support: The frequency of an itemset appearing in transactions.\
	\'95	Confidence: The probability that if one item appears, another item will also appear.\
	\'95	Lift: Measures how strongly two items are associated.\
\
Example: Market Basket Analysis\
\
If many customers buy bread and butter together, the rule can be:\
\
	Bread \uc0\u8594  Butter (If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter).\
\
Algorithms for ARM\
	\'95	Apriori Algorithm: Uses support and confidence thresholds to find frequent patterns.\
	\'95	FP-Growth Algorithm: More efficient than Apriori for large datasets.\
\
Conclusion\
\
Frequent pattern analysis helps in product recommendations, fraud detection, and customer behavior analysis. It is widely used in e-commerce, finance, and healthcare.\
