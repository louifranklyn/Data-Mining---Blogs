\f0\b\fs32 \cf2 Blog 7: Cluster Analysis\
\
Introduction\
Cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their characteristics. Unlike classification, clustering does not require labeled data. It is widely used in customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image recognition.\
\
How Clustering Works\
Clustering algorithms identify patterns and structures in data by grouping points with similar attributes. For example, an e-commerce website may use clustering to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.\
\
Types of Clustering Algorithms\
	1.	Partitioning Clustering (e.g., K-Means)\
	\'95	Divides data into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the nearest cluster center.\
	\'95	Example: A company segments customers into different groups based on their purchase history.\
	2.	Hierarchical Clustering\
	\'95	Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) that shows how data points are grouped.\
	\'95	Can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).\
	\'95	Example: Organizing animals into a hierarchy based on similarities.\
	3.	Density-Based Clustering (e.g., DBSCAN)\
	\'95	Groups data points based on density, ignoring noise and outliers.\
	\'95	Works well for clusters of arbitrary shapes.\
	\'95	Example: Identifying different clusters in geographical data, such as city areas with high population density.\
	4.	Model-Based Clustering (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models - GMM)\
	\'95	Assumes that data is generated from a mixture of probability distributions.\
	\'95	More flexible than K-Means but computationally expensive.\
	\'95	Example: Classifying different types of tumors in medical imaging.\
\
Evaluation Metrics in Clustering\
\
Since clustering is unsupervised, we do not have predefined labels to compare with. Instead, we use:\
	1.	Silhouette Score\
	\'95	Measures how similar a data point is to its assigned cluster compared to other clusters.\
	\'95	Ranges from -1 (poor clustering) to 1 (well-clustered).\
	2.	Inertia (Sum of Squared Errors - SSE)\
	\'95	Measures the compactness of clusters; lower values indicate better clustering.\
	3.	Davies-Bouldin Index\
	\'95	Measures the similarity between clusters; lower values indicate better separation.\
	4.	Dunn Index\
	\'95	Ratio of the minimum inter-cluster distance to the maximum intra-cluster distance.\
\
Real-World Applications of Clustering\
	\'95	Customer Segmentation: Businesses group customers based on spending patterns.\
	\'95	Image Segmentation: Used in facial recognition and medical imaging.\
	\'95	Anomaly Detection: Detecting fraudulent transactions in banking.\
	\'95	Recommender Systems: Netflix clusters users based on their viewing history.\
\
Conclusion\
Clustering is a powerful technique for identifying hidden patterns in data. It is widely used in marketing, healthcare, finance, and computer vision to uncover meaningful insights. By choosing the right clustering algorithm, businesses and researchers can make data-driven decisions without needing labeled datasets.}
