\f0\b\fs32 \cf2 Blog 3: Data Warehousing & Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)\
\
Introduction\
\
As organizations generate massive amounts of data, managing and analyzing it efficiently becomes crucial. Data Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) help businesses store, manage, and analyze large datasets for decision-making.\
\
What is Data Warehousing?\
\
A Data Warehouse (DW) is a central repository that stores historical and current data from different sources. It is designed for fast query performance and supports decision-making processes.\
\
Characteristics of Data Warehousing\
	1.	Subject-Oriented \'96 Focuses on business topics like sales, customers, or finance.\
	2.	Integrated \'96 Combines data from multiple sources.\
	3.	Time-Variant \'96 Stores historical data for trend analysis.\
	4.	Non-Volatile \'96 Data is read-only and does not change frequently.\
\
What is OLAP?\
\
OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is a technique used to analyze multidimensional data quickly. It enables businesses to perform complex queries on large datasets.\
\
Types of OLAP Operations\
	\'95	Roll-up: Aggregates data to a higher level (e.g., daily sales \uc0\u8594  monthly sales).\
	\'95	Drill-down: Breaks down data into finer details (e.g., country \uc0\u8594  city \u8594  store).\
	\'95	Slice and Dice: Filters and reorients data for analysis.\
	\'95	Pivot (Rotation): Reorganizes the dimensions of data for better visualization.\
\
Conclusion\
\
Data Warehousing and OLAP allow businesses to process vast amounts of data efficiently. They are essential for generating reports, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.}
